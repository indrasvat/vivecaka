## Current Status

**Phase 14: Feature Completion & Quality — COMPLETE**

Previously, Phases 0-13 built the scaffolding. An audit revealed ~25 features are missing or non-functional despite being marked "Done". Phase 14 addresses all gaps identified in the audit.

## How to Resume

1. Read this file — find the next `TODO` task below
2. Read the task file at `docs/tasks/NNN-task-name.md` — full context and steps
3. Read `CLAUDE.md` for conventions
4. Read relevant `docs/PRD.md` sections (listed in each task file)
5. Execute, verify (functional + visual via iterm2-driver), update this file, commit

Notes:
- Task 007: filter panel matches mock (static label options: enhancement/bug/docs; CI filter options: All/Passing/Failing; Review filter options: All/Approved/Pending). Pending CI + changes-requested review filters not exposed yet.
- Task 008: iterm2-driver markdown QA could not open PR detail (no open PRs in repo). Captured PR list screenshot only.
- Task 028: PR detail redesigned with 4 horizontal tabs (Description, Checks, Files, Comments). Tab bar has counts, active tab uses Primary color. Number keys 1-4, Tab/Shift-Tab, j/k/g/G navigation all working. Visual QA blocked by 0 open PRs in repo; functional tests pass.
- Task 011: **Fix applied (Feb 5, 2026):** Review form was rendering empty because `m.form.Init()` was never dispatched when entering review mode. Fixed by returning `a.reviewForm.Init()` from the `StartReviewMsg` handler. Also added `WithWidth` propagation. Verified on openclaw/openclaw: huh form renders with action select (Comment/Approve/Request Changes), text body, and Submit/Cancel confirmation. Navigation with arrow keys works. Escape cancels and returns to detail.
- Task 012: Reusable `ConfirmModel` with three-phase dialog: prompt → loading (animated spinner) → result (green ✓ success / red ✗ error with "Press any key to continue"). Checkout now shows "Check out branch X for PR #N?" → spinner during `gh pr checkout` → success result with branch name. Dialog stays centered and visible throughout — no more ephemeral toasts. Keys: Enter/y confirm, Esc/n cancel. `ViewConfirm` state added. `CheckoutPRMsg` extended with Branch field. **Bug fix:** `gh pr checkout` outputs to stderr, not stdout — adapter now uses `git branch --show-current` after checkout for reliable branch name. Verified end-to-end on openclaw/openclaw: confirmation, cancel (both n and Esc), actual checkout with loading spinner, success result, dismiss, and branch restoration all working.
- Task 022: Pagination implemented and fully verified. Initial load uses config.PageSize (default 50). When cursor nears bottom (within 5 items), LoadMorePRsMsg triggers, animated braille spinner shows, and PRs append via cumulative fetch. Header shows "loaded/total" format (e.g., "100/1896 open") using GraphQL API for total count. Tested on openclaw/openclaw repo (1,896 PRs). **Fix applied (Feb 5, 2026):** The original implementation used full field list including `statusCheckRollup` which caused GitHub API timeouts (HTTP 504) when fetching 100+ PRs. Fixed by using `prListFieldsLight` (excludes statusCheckRollup) for pagination requests. CI status will show as "—" for paginated items until detail view is opened; this is an acceptable tradeoff for reliable pagination. Verified: 50→100→150 PRs load successfully with ~1.5s per page.

Banner Polish:
- Replaced Devanagari विवेचक with 5 decorative Unicode symbol trios (e.g., ⟁·⟐·⌬, ⌖·⟡·⊹). Symbols are theme-colored (Primary/Secondary/Primary, muted dots) and rotate every 400ms during the 2s banner display.

- Task 013: Full repo switcher rewrite with three-source data model (favorites from config, user repos via `gh repo list` lazy/cached, manual owner/repo entry with ghost add). Aesthetic redesign: `⟡ Switch Repository` title, `❯` search prompt, `★` star indicator (Warning color), `●` current dot (Success), `▸` cursor, BgDim selected row, sectioned list with `╶── FAVORITES ──╴` / `╶── YOUR REPOS ──╴` headers, scroll indicators ▲/▼, key hints with theme colors. `s` key toggles favorite with config write-back via `UpdateFavorites()`. Fuzzy search filters both sections; ghost `+ add owner/repo` entry when query contains `/` and no match. Dedup: discovered repos exclude favorites. CWD repo auto-prepended to favorites on startup. 28 unit tests (model, view, search, toggle, ghost, sections, discovery). Config `UpdateFavorites()` round-trips TOML. Adapter `ListUserRepos()` + `ValidateRepo()` via `gh repo list/view`.

- Task 015: Auto-refresh polling implemented with `tea.Tick` every second. Countdown shown in header as `↻ 25s`. `p` key pauses/resumes (shows `⏸ paused`). When countdown reaches 0, triggers `loadPRsCmd` silently. Compares new PR count with previous; shows toast when new PRs detected. Refresh pauses automatically during non-list views (detail, diff, review). Uses config `refresh_interval` (default 30s).
- Task 016: Branch detection via `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD` on startup. Branch displayed in header as `⎇ main`. Tutorial `Show()` now called from `Init()` when `IsFirstLaunch()` returns true. Branch detection fires alongside repo detection in Init().
- Task 017: `e` key in diff view emits `OpenExternalDiffMsg`. App handles it via `tea.ExecProcess` with `gh pr diff N` and `GH_PAGER` env var set to configured external tool. If no tool configured, shows toast error. After tool exits, TUI resumes. Status hints updated to show `e ext diff`.
- Task 014: `GetInboxPRs` use case fetches PRs from all favorite repos in parallel via errgroup, tolerates partial failures. `I` key opens inbox from PR list. `OpenInboxPRMsg` switches repo context and loads PR detail. `PrioritySort` called on inbox data (review-requested > CI-failing > stale > normal). Usecase coverage stays at 100%.
- Task 021: Visual selection mode via `v` key. Space toggles selection (`●`/`○`), `a` selects all visible, Esc cancels. Batch operations: `y` copies all selected PR URLs (newline-separated), `o` opens all in browser. Status bar shows `N selected` count. Cursor uses `▸`/`▹` in selection mode. Quick filters m/n disabled during selection mode.
- Task 023: Cache package at `internal/cache/` with JSON file cache in `XDG_CACHE_HOME/vivecaka/repos/{owner}_{name}.json`. Atomic writes via temp file rename. `loadCachedPRsCmd` fires alongside fresh API load; cached data displayed immediately if still loading. `saveCacheCmd` runs as fire-and-forget after fresh load. `IsStale` checks TTL. 79.3% coverage.
- Task 029: Debug logging via `log/slog` to `XDG_STATE_HOME/vivecaka/debug.log`. Activated via `--debug` flag, `VIVECAKA_DEBUG=1` env var, or `debug = true` in config. Log rotation at 10MB. No-op logger when disabled. 91.3% coverage.
- Task 030: Smart checkout with three-mechanism zero-config system. (1) `RepoManager` interface in domain, adapter implements `CheckoutAt`, `CloneRepo`, `CreateWorktree`. (2) `repolocator` package with known-repos JSON registry (flock-based locking, atomic writes, auto-learning on launch). (3) `SmartCheckout` use case with `Plan()` decision cascade: StrategyLocal → StrategyKnownPath → StrategyNeedsClone. (4) Multi-state `CheckoutDialogModel` with 8 dialog states matching ASCII mocks (worktree choice, known-path confirm, clone options, custom path input, cloning spinner, checkout spinner, success, error). (5) Full app integration with `ViewSmartCheckout`, message routing for all dialog transitions, DR-2 nil-RepoManager fallback safety. (6) Plugin registry supports `RepoManager` auto-discovery. 8 atomic commits, 18 integration tests, all DR-1 through DR-12 fixes applied. CI clean.
- Task 024: Keybinding overrides wired via `ApplyOverrides(map[string]string)` on KeyMap. Config `[keybindings]` section parsed and applied on startup. Supports all binding names (quit, search, filter, etc.). Notification config struct already in place. Adaptive colors deferred (current hex colors work on all terminals).
- Task 027: Integration tests added in `internal/tui/integration_test.go` — 31 tests covering full message-passing flows: init→repo→PRs→list, banner→loading→PRList, open PR→detail→diff→back, review flow, checkout confirm flow, theme cycling, filter apply, repo switch, inline comment, error handling. Content verification tests for PR list (titles, authors, DRAFT), detail, help, loading, repo switcher. teatest skipped (experimental, no stability guarantee); manual message-passing used instead per BubbleTea v1 idiom. TUI coverage 33.8% → 48.1%.
- Task 026: Testing foundation complete. Created 5 fixture files in `internal/adapter/ghcli/testdata/` (pr_list.json, pr_detail.json, pr_comments.json, pr_checks.json, pr_diff.txt). Added `reader_test.go` with fixture-based tests for all conversion functions (toDomainPR, toDomainPRDetail, groupCommentsIntoThreads, toDomainCheck, ParseDiff, aggregateCI, mapState, mapReviewDecision, mapReviewState, mapCheckStatus). Migrated all 22 test files from raw `if/t.Error` to testify `assert/require`. Adapter coverage: 25.3% → 44.1%. Mock-based exec tests deferred to Task 027.
- Task 025: Per-repo state persistence via `internal/cache/state.go`. RepoState stores last sort, sort direction, filter opts, and last-viewed PR timestamps. State saved to `XDG_DATA_HOME/vivecaka/state/{owner}_{name}.json`. Filter/sort restored on startup. PR viewed timestamps tracked on detail open. IsUnread checks `updatedAt > lastViewed`. Cache coverage 80.0%.
- Task 019: Two-pane diff layout with file tree on left (25% width, 20-40 range) and diff content on right. Tab toggles focus between panes. Tree pane: j/k navigate files, Enter selects and returns focus to content. Content pane: all existing diff keys work. Active pane has distinct border color. File tree shows status icon (+/-/~), filename, +N -N counts. Help and status hints updated.
- Task 020: Side-by-side diff mode via `t` toggle. Split mode shows old/new files in aligned columns with `│` divider. Deletions paired with additions within hunks; context lines shown on both sides. Line numbers on each side. Mode label (Unified/Split) shown in file header. Synchronized scrolling. All existing keys (search, hunk jump, etc.) work in both modes.

Open Issues:
- ~~PR detail loading spinner appears stuck~~ **RESOLVED** (Feb 5, 2026): Spinner now animates correctly. Root causes addressed: (1) Fixed View() logic to only show loading state when `loading=true`, not when `detail==nil`; (2) Added explicit `return nil` for `PRDetailLoadedMsg` in Update(); (3) Verified spinner frames cycle properly via iTerm2 automation tests. The `gh pr checks` API call takes ~1.4s which causes visible spinner animation before PR detail loads.
- ~~Repo switcher search box captures shortcut keys~~ **RESOLVED** (Feb 6, 2026): Typing `j`, `k`, `s`, etc. in the repo switcher search box was intercepted as navigation/action shortcuts instead of being typed into the search input. Root cause: `key.Matches()` checked `j`/`k` (bound to Down/Up) before reaching the rune input handler. Fix: Restructured `handleKey` to use `msg.Type == tea.KeyUp/tea.KeyDown` (arrow-key-only navigation) and handle `tea.KeyRunes` for text input first. Tests updated.
- ~~Shift+T (theme cycle) shows "Loading PRs..."~~ **RESOLVED** (Feb 6, 2026): Pressing Shift+T to cycle themes destroyed all view model state because `rebuildStyles()` recreated every model from scratch. Fix: Added `SetStyles(core.Styles)` methods to all view models and components; `rebuildStyles()` now updates styles in-place without recreating models, preserving PR data, cursor positions, favorites, and all other state. Verified via iterm2-driver.
- ~~Global keys fire inside text-input views~~ **RESOLVED** (Feb 6, 2026): Typing `q`, `?`, `T`, or `R` in the repo switcher, filter panel, or review form triggered global shortcuts (quit, help, theme cycle, refresh) instead of being typed as text. Root cause: `handleKey` dispatched to global key handlers before checking if a text-input view was active. Fix: Added view interceptor block before global keys for `ViewRepoSwitch`, `ViewFilter`, `ViewReview` — all keys except Ctrl+C go directly to the active view's handler. Also fixed `ReviewModel.Update` to handle Escape before the nil-form early return, so Escape always closes the review view even if the form hasn't initialized. Verified across 3 repos (vivecaka, kitchen-sink, yukti) via iterm2-driver: 19/19 tests passed.

## Recommended Execution Order

Independent tasks (can be done in any order): 001, 002, 004, 005, 006, 008, 011, 012, 013, 015, 016, 017, 019, 021, 022, 023, 024, 026

Dependency chains:
- 002 → 003 (browser integration needed before detail key bindings use it)
- 006 → 007 (username detection before filter panel)
- 006 + 013 → 014 (username + favorites before inbox)
- 008 → 009 (glamour before chroma)
- 008 → 010 → 018 (markdown → comments → inline comments)
- 019 → 020 (two-pane before side-by-side)
- 001 + 007 + 023 → 025 (sort + filter + cache before persistence)
- 026 → 027 (testify + fixtures before integration tests)

## Phase 15: Review Flow Acceleration (Planned)

| # | Task File | Description | Status | Depends On |
|---|-----------|-------------|--------|------------|
| 031 | `docs/tasks/031-incremental-review-mode.md` | Incremental review mode: resume reviews from last visit/review with file-level progress | TODO | 018, 019, 020, 025, 028, 030 |

Planning notes:
- Task 031 is the next major feature proposal after Phase 14 completion.
- The implementation PRD lives in `docs/tasks/031-incremental-review-mode.md`.
- Baseline visual automation must exist before feature work begins so the current detail/files/diff layouts can be regression-tested during implementation.
