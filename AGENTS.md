# AGENTS.md

> **DO NOT UPDATE THIS FILE.** This file is static and intentional.

All agent memory, conventions, architecture rules, build instructions, task workflows, and project context live in **`CLAUDE.md`** at the repository root. That is the single source of truth.

When development produces new learnings, constraints, or convention changes, update `CLAUDE.md` — never this file.
